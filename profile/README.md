# Welcome to the github repository from the [ASCI group](https://www.fortiss.org/en/research/fields-of-research/detail/architectures-and-services-for-critical-infrastructures-1) at [fortiss](https://www.fortiss.org/en/)

## Introduction

Whether it involves self-driving vehicles or intelligent power networks, software platforms and the applications that operate on them play a crucial role. The growing complexity, such as with the coupling of the various sectors, places high requirements on the software architectures and interfaces.
Increasingly larger and heterogeneous volumes of data have to be transmitted, processed and interpreted. When it comes in particular to the efficient operation of utility infrastructures (electricity, heat, mobility, water), various domains and sectors have to interact and exchange information with one another.

With this in mind, the fortiss field Architectures and Services for Critical Infrastructures field of competence researches and develops analyses and methods in order to create software architectures for distributed infrastructures. These systems must be scalable, stable and robust. By modeling, simulating and applying AI methods, we are in a position to digitally represent, analyze and optimize complex systems.
Apart from describing interactions and application logic, the implemented platform can also be used to directly incorporate components through software. With this tool, we can design different rules and various control concepts, evaluate the operation and implement connected services based on data.

For this reason, the Architectures and Services for Critical Infrastructures field of competence is committed to making leading-edge research contributions in the field of real-time operations systems with the aim of helping to shape Bavaria and Germany into an attractive business location over the long term. To do that we focus our activities on the following trendsetting issues:

* What requirements will be placed on modern architectures in connected and distributed environments?
* How can these requirements be implemented in terms of software?
* What requirements do innovative and safety-critical real-time architectures have?
* How can algorithms be optimized in critical environments with respect to their power consumption?
